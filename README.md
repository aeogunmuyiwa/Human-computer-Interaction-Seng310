Human computer Interaction
Milestone 1: Instructors comment : Really Happy to see something different from a website and mobile app. 
A bit of extra research is required to understand the target users of this system.

Milestone 2: Instructors comment : Good work team, great job. Just one suggestion - you guys did a lot of hard work, you wrote 2 scenarios( i know there was a minimum required) but a good understanding requires more than 2 scenarios for sure.

Milestone 3: Instructors comment :We should be having a consistent layout during all the use cases. The screens were different for different use cases. Missing any type of alerts.

Assignment1 :Instructors comment : Part 1
Q2 metaphors and analogies should be explained Q3 this question is asking for objects and attribute but not tasks

Part 2
How part is missing in Q1. It woukd be better to have example in Q3,2Q5,7 too general and similar

Part 3
Formatting the answeres is really important, also feel free to ad screenshots to describe your answeres.
